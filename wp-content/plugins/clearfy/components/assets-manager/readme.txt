Increase the speed of the pages by disabling unused scripts (.JS) and styles (.CSS). Make your website REACTIVE!

== Description ==

You should know that, a lot of WordPress plugins developers forget performance when creating plugins. This means that a lot of them load self scripts/styles on every single post and or page of your site. This is not good, because it slows your site down.

That's why we created the WP Asset CleanUp plugin (Gonzales), with it, you can choose which scripts and styles should be loaded on the page, and which ones do not. One example of this would be with the Contact Form 7 plugin. With two clicks you can disable it everywhere except for on your contact page.

THIS PLUGIN’S BENEFITS INCLUDE

Decreases number of HTTP requests loaded (important for faster load)
Reduces the HTML code of the actual page (that’s even better if GZIP compression is enabled)
Makes source code easier to scan in case you’re a developer and want to search for something
Remove possible conflicts between plugins/theme (e.g. 2 JavaScript files that are loading from different plugins and they interfere one with another)
Better performance score if you test your URL on websites such as GTmetrix, PageSpeed Insights, Pingdom Website Speed Test
Google will love your website more as it would be faster and fast page load is nowadays a factor in search ranking
Your server access log files (e.g the Apache ones) will be easier to scan and would take less space on your server
